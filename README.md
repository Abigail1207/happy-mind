## Overview

The purpose of Happy Mind is to gently encourage the user into behaviours that will have a positive impact on their mental wellbeing. We used [advice from the NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/self-help/guides-tools-and-activities/five-steps-to-mental-wellbeing/) to structure our app, which is broken down into 3 main sections: [Interests / Hobbies](#interests), [Get Active](#active), and [Meditation](#meditation). We wanted the app to be largely minimalistic and unobtrusive - giving the user freedom to explore what they please, without being harrassed by excessive pop-ups, push notifications, or other prompts.
